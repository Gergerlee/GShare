<h1>The Requirements Stage - An example</h1>
<p>This document gives a brief example of the sort of things that the
requirements stage of the project should be concerned with. It starts with a
very brief description of the project, similar to those available to you, and
shows how this may be developed into a reasonable set of requirements from which
a report can be written. Note that there are no hard and fast rules for this
stage. We simply want you to think about the project you have chosen, and about
possible solutions to it, and communicate them in written and oral form. As far
as possible, try to be innovative. Do not let your current programming abilities
cloud your imagination. That is, at this stage, do not think about how you will
write such a program or how much effort it will take to do so. Later on we can
restrict the design to whatever is realistically possible in one semester and
leave the rest as extensions for improved versions in the future!</p>
<h3>Example Initial Problem Description</h3>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" width="90%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td><font color="#804040">The understanding/comprehension of paper-based
        documents is often aided by the inclusion of margin notes and by
        highlighting important sections using fluorescent marker pens. Since
        many people are now reading texts in electronic form, a program which
        can provide such aids to understanding would be a useful tool.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Although this description seems very explicit in asking for margin notes and
highlighting of electronic texts, it is a good idea to do a little brainstorming
at the start. Ask yourself what additional things one might do to help achieve
the goal of improving understanding of a text. Indeed, what exactly constitutes
improved understanding? Does it mean remembering details or being able to
appreciate the relationship of ideas inside or outside the specific text, or
does it entail doing these things quicker than would otherwise be the case? What
is or could be done with just paper and pencil? What further possibilities does
the computer offer? Newspapers, magazines and journals commonly provide
abstracts or summaries of books and articles. They may also offer reviews
(personal opinion or commentary) on the original text. References to related
material may be made, enabling it to be better placed in context. While margin
notes can handle almost everything one might wish to say about a text, they may
not always be the most convenient form. Certain tasks might be eased through the
use of "between-the-lines" comments or perhaps by
"crossing-out" some sections. The computer can obviously help in
several ways. For example, there need be no limit on the size of margin notes,
whole sections of text might be temporarily hidden or replaced with a summary.
Related material or sections could be available at the touch of a button, or the
same text could be marked in many different ways (perhaps by different people).
The possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>Another question you should probably ask yourself at this point, is who might
make use of such a program. Having identified possible users ask again what sort
of facilities the program might offer that would help them to do their job.
Obviously, in this case the intended users are researchers, and possibly
students, who have to read potentially long and complex texts as part of their
studies. However, once we recognise that the program is generally concerned with
the "marking-up" of a text, a number of other possible users come to
mind, for example, editors and teachers. What other facilities might they find
useful? Well, teachers grading student assignments might wish to write notes
which relate to two parts of a text, such as "you say this here, but then
contradict yourself here". They may wish to simply indicate passages which
are suspect, or which need rewriting, or which are particularly good or
important.</p>
<h3>Writing the Requirements Report</h3>
<p>Having done the brainstorming it is time to collect the ideas together and
present them. Your report is a formal document by which you and the project will
be judged, therefore, it is important that you make it as clear and precise as
possible. It must be prepared using this <a href="http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~adayanik/cs102/projectdocs/cs102ReportsTemplate.dot">
CS102 Project Reports template</a>. Note: This is a Word 2003 template that 
includes a macro to insert references into the text in the approved style. To 
enable the macro on newer versions of Word you need to click Review|Protect 
Document then select "Restrict Format &amp; Editing" and finally click the "Stop 
protection" button on the newly opened tab.</p>
<p>This particular report is going to be relatively short, however, it is
important that you present the ideas in a logical and easy to understand
fashion. Remember, if people can't make sense of what you are saying, they won't
buy the project/product and hence you will go hungry! The contents should offer
a functional description of the program you intend to produce. Perhaps the
easiest way to start this is to think of the report as if it were a sales
brochure for your finished program. In other words, think about the sort of
things you would need to say to potential customers in order to help them decide 
whether to buy/use
it (however, be careful not to exaggerate!) It should probably provide answers to the following sorts of question,</p>
<pre>   What is it for? Motivate the need for such a program.

   Who will use it?

   What does it do?

   What facilities does it provide?

   What advantages/features does it offer (disadvantages?)</pre>
<p>Do any similar products already exist? If so, provide brief details and 
references, and indicate what advantages yours might provide. Besides answering these questions it is 
also a good idea to try to distinguish
between features that you consider essential, those which are merely nice, and
those that will certainly be left for future extensions. The final report need
not be very long (three to five pages would be reasonable), however, it should be
self-contained, precise and easy to understand. Above all it should demonstrate
that you have thought about the problem. It should not make wild claims or use
advertising speak! Below is a brief example report for the problem given above
(obviously, yours should be longer and more detailed, and better structured).</p>

        <pre><font color="#804040"><u>Introduction</u></font></pre>
        <p><font color="#804040">Understanding long articles, particularly
        complex scientific texts, has always been something of a problem for
        researchers and students. There are a number of methods which readers
        commonly employ to help improve their understanding and/or comprehension
        of paper-based texts, including, for example, margin notes and
        highlighting with fluorescent marker pens. Increasingly, however, text
        is becoming available in electronic form where these techniques are not
        readily applied. We therefore propose an electronic reading aid which
        will provide the user with a range of facilities which can be employed
        to help improve comprehension of computer-based text. This tool will be
        of interest to researchers attempting to make sense of complex research
        articles and to students who may receive texts which have already been
        "marked-up" to make them easier to understand. Eventually
        authors may create their texts in such a form, making them more
        accessible right from the start. The tool will also be of interest to
        editors and teachers, since it will enable them to write comments,
        corrections, etc. on an electronic text, without disturbing the
        original.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040"><u>Features</u></font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040">The electronic reading aid functions by
        allowing users to create any number of different "views" on a
        given text. The original text remains unchanged, a view simply presents
        the document in a modified form, thus the reader can refer back to the
        original text whenever they wish. The program provides the following
        facilities:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040">- New views can be created and existing ones
        modified or deleted.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040">- Any section of text can be hidden and
        optionally replaced with some new text. This allows less important
        details to be hidden, or parts of the document to be summarised or
        rewritten. The changes will generally be presented in some clearly
        identifiable form, for example, a different font or colour, thus
        signaling to the reader that it is not the original text. Such
        modifications can be edited, temporarily undone, or permanently removed.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040">- Margin notes corresponding to any section of
        the text can be created, edited and deleted.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040">- The user can define styles (which specify in
        what font, colours, etc. the text should be shown) and use them to
        change the appearance of any section of a document. This feature allows
        for a generalisation of the idea of marking important parts of a text
        using a fluorescent pen. The user can create styles with names like
        "highlight", "excellent" and "rewrite,"
        each of which gets displayed in a different manner. For example,
        "highlight" might simply change the background colour to
        yellow, while "excellent" changes the text colour to green and
        "rewrite" is shown in strikeout.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040">- Search facilities which enable the user to
        rapidly locate any text string or type of modification. For example,
        find the next occurrence of the string "comput" or find the
        next occurrence of text in the "rewrite" style.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040">- The user can establish links between any two
        sections of a document and optionally add notes on the link. Readers
        will be able to quickly jump from text at one end of a link to text at
        the other and/or read the associated note. This facility will allow the
        reader to see relationships between various parts of a document or to
        quickly view references or notes which tend to be expanded at the end of
        technical articles.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040">- The ability to place freehand drawings
        (scribbles?) over any part of a document may be a useful feature. This
        is not considered essential and may be left for future versions.</font></p><p><font color="#804040"><u>
		Conclusion &amp; Reflections</u></font></p>
        <p><font color="#804040">This report developed the features required for 
		a new and, hopefully, unique product intended to help students, teachers 
		and researchers, improve their ability to understand complex texts. 
		Applying computer technology to what was previously a manual task, has 
		enabled us to come up with some new and innovative solutions that really 
		exploit the advantages technology can offer. </font></p>

<h3>Final Points to Remember</h3>
<p>The above report is only an example, one which could certainly be improved.
For example, there are other features which should perhaps have been included:
the ability to print a view or to save it as text, the facility to move a
section of text to another place, links to other files or url's, on-line help,
etc. There are also questions which still need answering, such as whether the
tool will work only with plain ascii text or whether it will allow HTML, MSWord,
Postscript &amp; RTF files to be worked on. The important point, however, is
that your intentions are now explicitly listed and available for discussion and
thus, hopefully, improvement. Sorting out a suitable set of requirements at the
beginning of a project will stop you wasting considerable time and money later.</p>
<p>Finally, do not leave it to the last minute to write the report. Ensure you
have enough time for at least one group member to <b>give it a critical reading
before submission</b>. Correct as many omissions and mistakes as you can, and do,
please, spell check your report before handing it in!</p>
